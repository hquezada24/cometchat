# Comet Chat

**Comet Chat** is a real-time messaging web application that allows users to **register, search for other users, and exchange messages** in a clean, modern interface.

Built as a full-stack project using **React**, **Express**, **Prisma**, and **PostgreSQL**, it demonstrates end-to-end development skills — from user authentication to database design and API integration.

## Features

- Search Users — find other registered users by name or username.

- Direct Messaging — send and receive messages in real time.

- Profile Management — users can update their personal information directly from their profile page.

- Persistent Conversations — all messages are stored in a PostgreSQL database via Prisma ORM.

- Dark Mode — implemented through React Context for global state management.
